    "# SEC Form 8-K - Material Event Disclosures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Publicly traded U.S. companies registered with the SEC must file Form 8-K for specific events as defined in 33 categories.\n",
    "- This filing, known as a \"Current Report,\" is to be publicly disclosed within four business days following a material event.\n",
    "- Form 8-K filings are triggered by specific occurrences, unlike scheduled 10-K or 10-Q filings.\n",
    "- The form is divided into sections labeled with item numbers (e.g., Item 1.01, Item 5.02) each addressing a different event type.\n",
    "- Item 8.01 is a \"catch-all\" category for events significant to security holders but not specified elsewhere in the form.\n",
    "- Events requiring 8-K disclosure include significant agreements, bankruptcy filings, stock delisting notices, financial statement errors, and changes in key leadership positions.\n",
    "- Companies based outside the U.S. but traded on U.S. markets file Form 6-K, such as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent.\n",
