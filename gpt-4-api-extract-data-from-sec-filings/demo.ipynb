       "On April 30, 2021, the Company filed with the SEC its General Form for Registration of Securities on Form 10-12G, and an amendment to Form 10-12G filed on August 9, 2021, together with all exhibits thereto, which included its Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 . In August 2021 the Former Auditor brought to the attention of the Company potential errors in the accounting related to the Company&#8217;s deferred tax liabilities and certain income tax disclosures. On January 26, 2022, after internal analysis and consultation with its technical accountants and counsel, the management of the Company determined that the Financial Statements should no longer be relied upon because the Company concluded that there was an error related to accounting for deferred tax liabilities. The error is deemed material to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and will result in the restatement of our financial statements.\n",

In connection with accounting for the acquisition, the Company recorded an intangible asset of approximately $3.8 million resulting in the creation of a deferred tax liability of $969,940. The tax provision in the Company&#8217;s Financial Statements netted this deferred tax liability against the Company&#8217;s deferred tax asset, reducing the Company&#8217;s valuation allowance. Upon further review, the Company and its technical advisors determined that because the Company and ITSQuest do not file a consolidated tax return, the deferred tax liability should not have been netted against the Company&#8217;s deferred tax asset. As a result, deferred tax liabilities and Goodwill were both understated by $969,940 as of December 31, 2020. In connection with this error, the Company&#8217;s management concluded that a material weakness exists in the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting with respect to the review and accounting for income taxes.\n",
