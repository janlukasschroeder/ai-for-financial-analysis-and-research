The tax provision in the Company&#8217;s Financial Statements netted this deferred tax liability against the Company&#8217;s deferred tax asset, reducing the Company&#8217;s valuation allowance. Upon further review, the Company and its technical advisors determined that because the Company and ITSQuest do not file a consolidated tax return, the deferred tax liability should not have been netted against the Company&#8217;s deferred tax asset. As a result, deferred tax liabilities and Goodwill were both understated by $969,940 as of December 31, 2020.
